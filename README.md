# Steem -> Rethinkdb Ingestor in Golang

Totally a WIP.  May be switching to cockroachDB.  Will provide both rethinkdb and cockroach for anyone interested.  


Ingestron:  It eats blocks and shits rows.

Ingestron is getting a re-factor right now, and when it comes back it should be able to manage offloading the blockchain to nearly arbitrary dbs in aritrary ways.
